# The-GitHub-History-of-the-Scala-Language
In this project, I read, clean up, and visualize the project repository of Scala that spans data from a Vers Cont Sys (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. I find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
